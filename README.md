# CMOS Fabrication Process

- Here, we will discuss CMOS fabrication of nMOS and pMOS structure on P-type substrate.

- The below diagram shows how nMOS and pMOS can be fabricated on a P-type well.

- From the above diagram, we can see that Source (S) and Drain(D) of pMOS has p+ type material and n-type channel. Similarly, Source (S) and Drain (D) of nMOS have n+ type material and p-type channel.

- As we are fabricating nMOS and pMOS on P-type substrate we first need to have an n-well. For pMOS, we will first have an n-well and then have p+ material for Source and Drain. With p-type substrate nMOS directly can be created with n+ Source and Drain.

- Similarly, if we want to have nMOS and pMOS on N-type substrate then we will have a p-well of nMOS and pMOS will be directly created on N-type substrate.

- Gate terminals are insulated for the channel material by the SiO2 layer.
This oxide layer is thin at the gate and thick at the active(Source and Drain) region.

- Steps for CMOS Fabrication are as follows:

### 1] Create n well or p well region and channel stop region:

- For nMOS and pMOS special region must be created in which the semiconductor type will be opposite to the substrate type, these regions are called wells or tubes.

- p well is created on an n-type substrate and n well is created on a p-type substrate.

- nMOS transistor can be created on a p-type substrate or p well and pMOS transistors can be created on an n-type substrate or n well.

- That well should be of defined boundary to have fixed channel stop region to avoid crosstalk or mutual coupling effects.

### 2] Grow field oxide or SiO2 (Thick Oxide) layer and gate oxide(Thin oxide).

- Thick oxide is grown on the active region of nMOS and pMOS.

- Thin gate oxide is grown on the surface through thermal oxidation.

### 3] Deposit and Pattern Polysilicon layer:

- As per the circuit make a pattern of polysilicon layer.

### 4] Implant source, drain region, and substrate contacts:

- After having n well or p well regions, we create n+ or p+ regions for source, drain, and substrate.

### 5] Create contact windows, deposit, and pattern metal layer:

- Final metallization for metal interconnects.
