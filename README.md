# CMOS Fabrication Process

- Here, we will discuss **CMOS fabrication of nMOS and pMOS structure on P-type substrate**.

- The below diagram shows how nMOS and pMOS can be fabricated on a P-type well.

- From the above diagram, we can see that **Source (S)** and **Drain(D)** of pMOS has **p+** type material and **n-type** channel. Similarly, **Source (S)** and **Drain (D)** of nMOS have **n+** type material and **p-type** channel.

- As we are fabricating nMOS and pMOS on P-type substrate we first need to have an n-well. For pMOS, we will first have an n-well and then have p+ material for Source and Drain. With p-type substrate nMOS directly can be created with n+ Source and Drain.

- Similarly, if we want to have nMOS and pMOS on N-type substrate then we will have a p-well of nMOS and pMOS will be directly created on N-type substrate.

- Gate terminals are insulated for the channel material by the SiO2 layer.
This oxide layer is thin at the gate and thick at the active(Source and Drain) region.

**- Step 1: Create n well or p well region and channel stop region:**

- For nMOS and pMOS special region must be created in which the semiconductor type will be opposite to the substrate type, these regions are called wells or tubes.

- p well is created on an n-type substrate and n well is created on a p-type substrate.

- nMOS transistors can be created on a p-type substrate or p well and pMOS transistors can be created on an n-type substrate or n well.

- That well should be of defined boundary to have fixed channel stop region to avoid crosstalk or mutual coupling effects.

- Refer Figures 1, 2, and 3.

**- Step 2: Grow field oxide or SiO2 (Thick Oxide) layer and gate oxide(Thin oxide).**

- Thick oxide is grown on the active region of nMOS and pMOS.

- Thin gate oxide is grown on the surface through thermal oxidation.

- The oxidation process can be used to grow the SiO2 layer.

- Refer Figures 4 and 5.

**- Step 3: Deposit and Pattern Polysilicon layer:**

- As per the circuit, make a pattern of the polysilicon layer.

- For implant Source and Drain terminals we now etch the polysilicon and SiO2 layer.

- Refer Figures 6 and 7.

**- Step 4: Implant source, the drain region, and substrate contacts:**

- After having n well or p well regions, we create n+ or p+ regions for source, drain, and substrate.

- Refer Figures 8 and 9.

**- Step 5: Create contact windows, deposit, and pattern metal layer:**

- Final metallization for metal interconnects.

- Refer Figures 10, 11, and 12.

- In this way, we follow the above basic series of steps for CMOS Fabrication.
